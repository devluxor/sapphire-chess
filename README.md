# Ruby Chess

Hi!

Welcome to my pure Ruby chess game!

The game is now 100% functional. However, I'm still working on it, refactoring, fixing new found bugs, and adding new features almost every day. Every suggestion or comment will be more than welcome.

Please, feel free to visit `MAP.rb` for a description of the program design and mechanics, and `TODO.md` to read a list with all the features I've been working/will be working.

To play, just execute `main.rb`.

Thank you!

Best, 

Lucas.
